Commodore 64 Game Base Online

## So what is this

This is an attempt to *not* having to have the entire library of Commodore 64 games copied locally to my own computer, but rather have them downloaded on the fly, whenever I wish to play them.

As I discovered that *8bitfiles.net* had all files needed hosted at their site, I got the idea of downloading single games at a time, and running them.

It developed into the idea of a game selection screen, and as all the game information is stored with each game, also the idea of having all info cached locally came along.

The version you see here will do just that.

Whenever you select a game, the information for that game is shown, along with the music being played, if such music exists.

Have fun.
